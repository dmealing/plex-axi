# Local CI — every check `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs, runnable without GitHub.
#
# GitHub Actions is disabled on this repository, so the workflow's jobs run
# nowhere unless something local runs them. This script is that something: the
# no-mistakes gate calls it (see `.no-mistakes.yaml`), a developer can run it
# before pushing, and `ci.yml` calls it one section per job, so the checks are
# the same whether or not Actions ever comes back.
#
# Sections, in the order a bare run executes them:
#
#   leakcheck  scripts/leakcheck.py --demo, then the scan of every tracked file
#   commits    scripts/commitcheck.py --demo, then --since-release with
#              --pull-requests require, or auto with no GitHub token (see below)
#   lint       ruff check . && ruff format --check .
#   test       pytest, once, on the interpreter that built .venv
#   skill      plex-axi skill --check
#   model      metaobjects verify --codegen, then the capture report
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci-local.sh                        # every section
#   scripts/ci-local.sh --only lint            # one section; repeat --only for more
#   scripts/ci-local.sh --matrix               # also run pytest on every MATRIX_PYTHONS
#   scripts/ci-local.sh --help
#
# THE TEST MATRIX DECISION. `test` runs the suite once, on the interpreter that
# built .venv. That is what the gate runs, because it is the cost every change
# pays. The supported range (3.10 through 3.12; `requires-python = ">=3.10"` in
# pyproject.toml, held to the ci.yml matrix by tests/test_python_floor.py) is
# checked on demand with `--matrix`, which builds a throwaway `uv` venv per
# version and runs pytest in each. `--matrix` needs `uv` on PATH and fails if it
# is missing, because a matrix that silently ran nothing reads like one that
# passed. Override the versions with MATRIX_PYTHONS="3.10 3.12".
#
# THE TOKEN. `commits` reads pull request bodies from GitHub, because a body can
# replace a commit message outright (AGENTS.md, "Releasing"). The token comes
# from GITHUB_TOKEN, then GH_TOKEN, then `gh auth token`. When none can be
# obtained the --since-release audit still runs, over every git-side message,
# under --pull-requests auto: only the pull-request-body half is skipped, the
# SKIP line says so, and commitcheck prints its own NOT-consulted note beside
# the verdict.
#
# NODE. tests/test_commit_message.py compares the Python transcription of the
# commit grammar with the vendored upstream parser, and skips that comparison
# where `node` is absent. ci.yml installs node; a local run enforces the
# agreement only where `node` is on PATH.
#
# THE MODEL TOOLCHAIN. `model` proves the committed generated files are what
# metaobjects/ and the shared generators in axi-toolkit emit. The toolchain needs a newer Python than this
# package's floor, so it runs under `uvx --python 3.12` and never touches .venv;
# like `--matrix`, it fails without `uv` on PATH rather than passing unrun.
#
# NOT COVERED. hygiene.yml's pull request title and body leak scan
# (`leakcheck.py --pull-request N`) has no local home: the text it scans exists
# only on GitHub, after the pull request is opened.
#
# The environment is .venv, built by scripts/dev-setup.sh when it is missing,
# and every tool is called as .venv/bin/<tool> — never off PATH, for the reason
# AGENTS.md gives under "Continuous integration".
#
# To reuse this shape elsewhere: each section is one function named `sec_<name>`
# and one entry in SECTIONS. Nothing else needs to change.
