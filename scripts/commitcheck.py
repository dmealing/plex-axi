"""Reject a commit message that release-please cannot parse.

Release automation that reports success while shipping nothing is worse than
automation that fails, and that is exactly what happened here: a merged fix sat
on ``main`` unreleased while the release workflow exited 0 with ``Considering: 0
commits``. release-please catches every parse error, logs ``commit could not be
parsed`` at debug level, and carries on with the commits it *could* read -- so a
message it chokes on is silently dropped from the changelog and from the version
bump, and the run stays green.

The rule that bit us
--------------------

release-please 17.3.0 parses commit messages with ``@conventional-commits/parser``
(``^0.4.1``), the reference implementation of the Conventional Commits grammar.
That grammar tries to read **every physical line of the body** as a ``<footer>``::

    <footer> ::= <token>, <separator>, <whitespace>*, <value>
    <token>  ::= <type>, "(" <scope> ")", ["!"] | <type>
    <type>   ::= 1*<any UTF8-octet except newline, parens, "!", ":" or whitespace>
    <scope>  ::= 1*<any UTF8-octet except newline or parens>

``<type>`` swallows characters from the start of the line until it meets one of
whitespace, a newline, ``!``, ``:``, ``(`` or ``)``. If the character it stops on
is ``(``, the parser **commits** to reading a scope: it consumes up to the next
``(``, ``)`` or newline, and if that character is not ``)`` it *throws*::

    if (scanner.peek() !== ')') {
      throw scanner.abort(node, [')'])          // lib/parser.js:177
    }

That ``throw`` is one of only four in the whole grammar, and it is the only one
reachable from the body. Every other production reports failure by *returning* an
``Error`` its caller can back out of; this one unwinds the entire parse. So a line
like::

    `Decimal(repr(value))` inside the canonical range - the shortest round-tripping

is unparseable, while the identical phrase one word further along the line is
fine. It is not parentheses, not backticks, not the dash and not the position on
its own -- it is the interaction: **a body line whose first character begins an
unbroken run of non-space, non-parenthesis, non-``!``, non-``:`` characters that
is immediately followed by ``(``, where the parenthesis does not close before the
next ``(`` or the end of that line.**

Rich commit bodies are not the problem and are not what this guard restricts. A
line reflowed by one word, or a space before the parenthesis, satisfies the
grammar with the prose intact.

The message is not always the message
-------------------------------------

The rule above was diagnosed correctly and the guard built on it still passed a
commit release-please dropped, because it was reading the wrong string.
release-please parses ``splitMessages(preprocessCommitMessage(commit))``, and
``preprocessCommitMessage`` is this::

    const overrideMessage = (commit.pullRequest.body.split('BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE')[1] || '')
      .split('END_COMMIT_OVERRIDE')[0]
      .trim()
    if (overrideMessage) return overrideMessage

``String.split`` finds that literal **anywhere in the pull request body**,
including inside a sentence that merely names it. So a pull request whose body
*explained* this mechanism handed release-please the paragraph that followed the
word, as the commit message. It began ``block from the PR body when there is
one``, ``block`` is five characters, and the parser stopped on the space after
it: ``unexpected token ' ' at 1:6``. The commit message itself parsed perfectly,
which is why a checker that only ever saw the commit message reported success.

Three artefacts reach release-please and only one of them passes under a
commit-msg hook:

============================  ==========================  =====================
artefact                      written                     checked by
============================  ==========================  =====================
the commit message            locally, by a developer     ``--commit-msg``
the merge commit's message    in GitHub's merge box       ``--since-release``
the pull request body         in GitHub's editor          ``--pull-request``
============================  ==========================  =====================

The body is the dangerous one: it *replaces* the other two, it can be edited
after every check has run, and nothing in the repository records it. So the
audit modes resolve it from GitHub rather than trusting git, and refuse to
report a verdict they cannot support.

One rule here is stricter than upstream, deliberately. Upstream is happy with an
override block that is never closed -- it reads to the end of the body -- and
that is exactly the shape an accidental mention takes. A body that names the
marker must close the block, so that an accidental mention whose next paragraph
*happens* to parse cannot silently become the changelog entry.

Two engines, one answer
-----------------------

``--engine node`` runs the real parser: ``vendor/conventional-commits-parser/``
holds a byte-for-byte copy of the four dependency-free modules that make it up,
so ``node`` alone runs it with no ``npm install`` and no network. That is the
authoritative answer, because it is upstream's own code rather than a description
of it.

``--engine python`` runs the transcription in this file -- a line-by-line port of
the same grammar -- so a machine with no ``node`` still gets a verdict rather than
a skip. ``tests/test_commit_message.py`` runs the whole corpus through both and
asserts they agree on the verdict *and* on the reported line, column and token; a
guard whose fallback disagreed with the thing it stands in for would be worse than
none.

``--engine auto`` (the default, and what the hooks use) prefers ``node``.

Usage:
  scripts/commitcheck.py --commit-msg PATH    check one message file (the hook)
  scripts/commitcheck.py --message TEXT       check a literal message
  scripts/commitcheck.py --commit SHA         check one commit as release-please reads it
  scripts/commitcheck.py --pull-request N     check what a merge will hand release-please
  scripts/commitcheck.py --range A..B         check every commit message in a range
  scripts/commitcheck.py --since-release      check every commit since the released tag
  scripts/commitcheck.py --rules              explain the rule, the engines and the allowances
  scripts/commitcheck.py --demo               self-test: prove it still rejects and still accepts

The modes that name a commit or a pull request read pull request bodies from
GitHub, with a token from ``GITHUB_TOKEN``, ``GH_TOKEN`` or ``gh auth token``.
``--pull-requests require`` (the workflows) fails without one rather than
checking a different artefact and calling it green.

Exit status is 0 when every message parses and 1 when one does not, so the hooks
and the release workflow can both use it directly.

Standard library only, so the hooks run without the project's virtualenv.
