"""Block library-specific and installation-specific data from this public repository.

plex-axi talks to a Plex Media Server, so the failure mode that matters is not a
bug -- it is a commit that quietly describes, or grants access to, the library it
was developed against. A Plex library is unusually rich in exactly the wrong
things: real artist and album names, absolute paths to somebody's music files,
the server's ``machineIdentifier``, and a token that is a bearer credential for
the whole library. A rule a human has to remember is not a control, so this
scanner runs from a pre-commit hook, a commit-msg hook, and CI.

It looks for shapes rather than a denylist of known-bad strings, because the
strings that matter are the ones nobody thought to list. See RULES below for the
current set. Real *content* -- an artist name, an album title -- has no shape and
cannot be detected here; that half is a convention (invent obviously-synthetic
names) recorded in AGENTS.md, and the README says the coverage is bounded.

Two passes run over every file:

* a line pass, which reports the exact line; and
* a condensed pass, which strips whitespace, quotes, backslashes and ``+`` from
  the whole file before re-applying the token rules. A credential split over
  several source lines, or assembled by concatenation, is invisible to a line
  pass -- and splitting a token over fragments is exactly how someone hides one,
  deliberately or not. The condensed pass is restricted to the token rules
  because joining arbitrary lines can fuse unrelated digits into a plausible
  address, and a guard that cries wolf gets bypassed.

Usage:
  scripts/leakcheck.py                     scan every tracked file
  scripts/leakcheck.py --staged            scan the staged content of a commit
  scripts/leakcheck.py --commit-msg PATH   scan a commit message
  scripts/leakcheck.py PATH [PATH...]      scan explicit files or directories
  scripts/leakcheck.py --demo              scan a synthetic dirty tree and expect failure
  scripts/leakcheck.py --rules             list the rules and what each one catches

A line may carry `leakcheck: allow=<rule>[,<rule>]` to exempt itself from those
named rules. The exemption is deliberately per-rule: a blanket marker would
switch off every rule on the line, including one nobody was thinking about when
they wrote it, which is how a live credential hides behind a suppressed lint.

PATH_ALLOWANCES says the same thing for a file that cannot carry a marker at
all. It is per-path AND per-rule for the same reason, and `--rules` prints it,
because an exemption nobody can see is one nobody re-examines.

Standard library only, so the hooks run without the project's virtualenv.
