"""The guard that keeps an unreleasable commit message off `main`.

`scripts/commitcheck.py` answers one question -- would release-please read this
commit, or silently drop it? -- and the answer is only worth anything if it is
the same answer release-please's own parser gives. So this suite is built the
way `test_toon_conformance.py` is: the project's opinion is stated in its own
words *and* checked against a vendored copy of the upstream implementation.

Three things are pinned here, and they are not interchangeable:

* **The regression.** The real, byte-for-byte message of the commit that was
  lost, with the exact position the release workflow reported. A guard written
  from a description of a bug is a guard against the description.
* **The corpus.** Shapes that must be refused and, just as important, the rich
  bodies this fleet writes that must keep working. A validator that quietly
  started refusing prose would be the more expensive failure, because the answer
  to it is to stop writing the prose.
* **The agreement.** Every corpus entry through both engines, compared on the
  verdict *and* on the reported line, column and token. The Python transcription
  stands in for the real parser wherever `node` is absent, and a stand-in that
  disagreed would be worse than a skip.

And one thing that is not a shape at all. The first version of this guard was
correct about the grammar and still passed the commit release-please dropped,
because it checked the wrong string: release-please parses
`splitMessages(preprocessCommitMessage(commit))`, and preprocess replaces the
whole message with the override block in the pull request body whenever that
body so much as *names* the marker. So the second regression pinned here is a
message that parses perfectly, refused because of a body written somewhere else.
