"""The official TOON conformance fixtures, run against this encoder.

`tests/test_toon.py` states the encoder's behaviour in this project's own words,
which is worth having and is not the same thing as conformance: a rule nobody
thought to write a test for reads as passing. These fixtures are the
specification's own opinion, vendored byte-for-byte from `toon-format/spec`
(MIT; see `fixtures/toon-spec/PROVENANCE.md`), so the strict-encoder claim in the
README is a property this suite checks rather than one the docs assert.

Every case in `fixtures/toon-spec/encode/` runs, and all of them must pass. The
count is asserted too: a fixture file deleted, emptied or left unparsed would
otherwise shrink the suite in silence, which is exactly how a partial score
ships.

Cases are keyed on file name and array index, never on the fixture's prose
`name` -- upstream rewrites those whenever the specification's terminology
changes, and a runner keyed on them breaks on a refresh that changed nothing.
